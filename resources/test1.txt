Unrequited love or one-sided love is love that is not openly reciprocated or understood as such by the beloved. 
The beloved may not be aware of the admirer's deep and strong romantic affection, or may consciously reject it. 
The Merriam Webster Online Dictionary defines unrequited as "not reciprocated or returned in kind."
